        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Who are you</h2>
        <p>I'm Haris Jacobs, a 16 year old programmer, musician, cricketer and <s>general nerd</s> from Liverpool in England!</p>
        <h2>Programming & Computer Science</h2>
        <p>My programming journey started in 2016, when we were first introduced to the drag and drop <a href="https://www.scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> programming language in primary school. It was really fun.</p>
        <p><span>My programming journey started again in 2020, with the lockdown meaning I had a lot of time on my hands. This meant that of course, I had a lot of time to watch videos on Youtube. Whilst this may seem like peak procrastination and anti-productivity, slowly, more and more videos about Computer Science and Programming began to make their way into the recommended section, which caught my intrigue showing what was possible with the same coding that we had learnt how to do in school, but just at a higher level. </span><br>
            <span>The next obvious thing for me to do was to try and properly learn how to code in Python, which was the programming language that we had looked at in school at the time. However, I soon realised that my true calling was not in colons and indentation but in semi-colons and curly brackets. In particular, Youtube once again influenced my life choices by introducing me to a language called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.processing.org">Processing</a>, which is based on Java but has a built-in drawing canvas. This is what really caught my intrigue, since interacting with visuals on screen was much more interesting than peering through the Python console.</span><br>
            <span>This interest for Processing was only compounded by the Youtube channels <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain">The Coding Train</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@carykh">Carykh</a>, whom I must thank for being major inspirations during my journey as a coder.</span><br>

                My first introduction to website development was in 2021 working on a project that myself and a group of friends had thought of: <a href=https://theeconomicway.github.io/ target="_blank">our own news website</a>.
            </span>
            <span>
                Whilst our research did almost entirely consist of the corresponding BBC article to our topic of interest, my main role was to be part of the "Software team", consisting of myself and my <a href="https://www.ahsan-a.github.io" target="_blank">good friend</a>. The majority of my work on the website was staring in awe as he made it look pretty; all I could offer up was the limited aid of copy-pasting our articles into the correct html files. The GOAT debate for some reason continues to this day even though he's clearly better.

                In the years since learning Processing I branched out into other similar languages, first and foremost the Javascript equivalent of Processing: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.p5js.org">p5.js</a>. I found p5.js to be a great tool with a great community, such as the project sharing website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openprocessing.org">OpenProcessing</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://openprocessing.org/user/224122/?o=48&view=sketches">which I have a lot of stuff on so go have a look.</a> (some of the projects <a href="index.html" target="_blank">are also shown on this website</a>)
            </span>
            <span>
                I also dipped my toe into game development using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unity.com">Unity game engine</a> using the C# programming language (which I'd describe as "Microsoft Java"), some of the results of which you can see <a target="_blank" href="https://itch.io">here.</a> Don't even get me started on the influence (globally) of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Danidev">this man</a> and his games.

                Working on it. The website and actually having a life.
